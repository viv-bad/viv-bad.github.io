## About Me

I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer with a PhD in Chemistry, passionate about building scalable applications that solve complex scientific and engineering problems. Currently based in London with previous experience working in Mexico City, I specialize in renewable energy technologies, fintech platforms, and materials science applications.

My unique background combines deep technical expertise in chemistry and materials science with modern software engineering practices. I've architected and developed production systems that have processed over $1M in financial transactions, delivered 47+ commercial solar installations in LATAM, and enabled data-driven research for 20+ scientists.

### My Focus Areas

- **Renewable Energy & Climate Tech:** Building tools for photovoltaic simulations, energy modeling, and sustainable technology optimization. Experience with large-scale solar project platforms and AI-driven energy recommendations.

- **Scientific Computing & Materials Discovery:** Developing machine learning models for molecular property prediction, laboratory information management systems, and computational workflows for experimental optimization.

- **Fintech & Data Engineering:** Creating scalable financial platforms with real-time processing capabilities, risk assessment algorithms, and automated decision-making systems.

### Technical Expertise

I work across the full stack with **Python** (FastAPI, Flask), **JavaScript/TypeScript** (React, Vue.js, Node.js), and cloud platforms (**AWS**, **Azure**). My scientific background gives me a unique perspective on translating complex physics, chemistry and engineering problems into robust software solutions.

**Currently seeking opportunities** in AI-driven simulation, materials discovery, or climate technology where I can apply both my software engineering skills and scientific domain expertise.
