My research focuses on the intersection of materials science, renewable energy, and computational methods. I've published extensively on enzyme-electrode interfaces, CO2 reduction catalysis, and artificial photosynthesis systems - work that now informs my approach to building software solutions for scientific and engineering challenges.

These publications represent collaborations with leading researchers at the University of Cambridge and international institutions, contributing to our understanding of sustainable energy technologies and catalytic processes.
