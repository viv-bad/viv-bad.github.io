After spending years in academic electrochemistry research and then building production energy systems at Solara, I've noticed something fascinating: most energy simulations are wrong in predictable ways.

## The Academic vs. Reality Gap

In my PhD, I built beautiful models for enzyme-electrode interfaces that worked perfectly under controlled lab conditions. Clean systems, pure chemicals, constant temperature. The math was elegant, the predictions precise.

Then I started building software for real solar installations in Mexico.

Suddenly I'm dealing with:

- Dust accumulation on panels (not in any textbook)
- Wildly varying weather patterns that don't match historical averages
- Electrical systems that behave differently as they age
- Human factors (contractors taking shortcuts, maintenance schedules ignored)

## The Problem with Traditional Simulation Software

Most energy simulation tools treat the physical world like a chemistry lab—clean, predictable, isolated. They're built by engineers who've never had to explain to a frustrated contractor why their "95% accurate" model predicted 40% more energy production than reality delivered.

Here's what they typically miss:

**1. Degradation isn't linear.** Solar panels don't lose efficiency in a nice, smooth curve. They have cliff drops when specific failure modes kick in.

**2. Weather data is historical fiction.** Using 20-year weather averages for a system that needs to work _this year_ is like navigating with a map from 1950.

**3. System interactions compound errors.** A 5% error in irradiance prediction becomes a 15% error in energy output when combined with temperature coefficient miscalculations and inverter efficiency variations.

## Our Solution: Physics-Informed Software Engineering

At Solara, we took a different approach. Instead of building another simulation engine, we created a system that:

- **Learns from reality**: Every installation feeds real performance data back into our models
- **Embraces uncertainty**: We don't predict single numbers; we predict distributions with confidence intervals
- **Updates continuously**: Machine learning models retrain monthly with new weather and performance data

The result? We went from days of manual calculations to 2-minute automated proposals with _higher_ accuracy than traditional methods.

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about solar panels. Whether you're modeling molecular interactions, financial systems, or climate impacts, the same principles apply:

1. **Start with physics**, but don't end there
2. **Build feedback loops** between your models and reality
3. **Design for uncertainty** rather than false precision
4. **Use software engineering practices** to make science scalable

The most interesting problems today aren't purely computational or purely physical—they're at the intersection. That's where a chemistry PhD who can also architect microservices becomes unexpectedly valuable.
